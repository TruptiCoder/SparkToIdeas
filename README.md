# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

## 🔬 1. Diabetes Prediction

## 📧 2. Email Spam Detection

This repository contains two machine learning projects built with **sklearn** and deployed using **Tkinter GUI**:

* **Diabetes Prediction**
* **Email Spam Detection**

Each project involves:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Saving the model using `joblib`
* Developing a user-friendly GUI

## 🔬 Diabetes Prediction

### 📌 Description

This project uses patient health metrics to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The data is scaled, and a **RandomForestClassifier** is trained. The model and scaler are saved with `joblib` and loaded in a **Tkinter-based GUI** for easy predictions.

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd "Diabetes prediction"
   ```

2. (Optional) Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy tkinter joblib
   ```

3. Run the GUI:

   ```bash
   python GUI.py
   ```

## 📧 Email Spam Detection

### 📌 Description

This project classifies email messages as spam or not spam using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier**. The text data is vectorized using CountVectorizer, and both the model and vectorizer are saved using `joblib`. The application is deployed in a **Tkinter GUI** for real-time classification.

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd "Spam Detection"
   ```

2. (Optional) Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk joblib
   ```

3. Run the GUI:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## 📦 Requirements

Here's a combined list of important libraries used:

```txt
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
joblib
nltk
tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
```

## 📚 Future Enhancements

* Add performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) in GUI
* Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
* Add logging and input validation
